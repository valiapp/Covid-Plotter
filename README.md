## Credits

This is an up-to-date version of [Coursera's 'Mastering Programming with MATLAB' course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-matlab-programming) assignment. More specifically, this repository does not use the 'covid_data.mat' file that was provided by Coursera and contained COVID-19 pandemic data from the beggining of the pandemic till a very specific/non-changing date. Instead, it uses data from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) which is updated every day with the latest data from all over the world.
